## Bitwise Operations Overview

### AND - To Extract
The AND operation is used to extract specific bits from a binary number by masking them. The logic works as follows:

- **AND with 0**: Turns the bit off (sets it to 0).
- **AND with 1**: Keeps the bit as it is.

### OR - To Set
The OR operation is used to set specific bits to 1. The logic is as follows:

- **OR with 0**: Keeps the bit as it is.
- **OR with 1**: Turns the bit on (sets it to 1).

### XOR - To Toggle
The XOR operation is used to toggle specific bits (flip them between 1 and 0). The logic is as follows:

- **XOR with 1**: Toggles the bit (flips 1 to 0 and 0 to 1).
- **XOR with 0**: Keeps the bit as it is.
