### Weak Forms of Isolation

#### Types of Concurrency Bugs

- **Dirty Reads:**
    - Reading data before a write is completed. This can lead to inconsistencies as uncommitted changes are read by another transaction.

- **Dirty Writes:**
    - Overwriting non-committed data. This occurs when one transaction overwrites the uncommitted changes of another transaction.

- **Read Skew (Non-repeatable Reads):**
    - Reading data while it is being written. The same transaction might read different values if the data it is reading is being modified by another transaction concurrently.

- **Lost Updates:**
    - Occurs when two transactions read, modify, and write a value, resulting in one write being lost. This happens because the second transaction overwrites the changes made by the first transaction without considering its modifications.

- **Write Skew:**
    - Occurs when two transactions concurrently make updates based on an initial read state, leading to an inconsistent database state. For example, two transactions checking the same condition and updating different records based on that condition.

- **Phantoms:**
    - Occurs when a transaction reads a set of rows that satisfy a condition but another transaction inserts or deletes rows that would affect the initial transactionâ€™s results. This can lead to inconsistent query results.

#### How to Solve Concurrency Bugs

- **Read Committed Isolation:**
    - Ensures that any data read is committed at the moment it is read. It prevents dirty reads and writes by making sure that reads only see committed data.
    - Weakest isolation level that focuses on preventing dirty reads and dirty writes.

- **Snapshot Isolation:**
    - Ensures that transactions operate on a consistent snapshot of the database, thus preventing read skew and lost updates. Each transaction reads from its own snapshot, making concurrent writes visible only after commit.

- **Predicate Locks and Materializing Conflicts:**
    - Ensures that locks are placed on sets of rows that satisfy a certain condition (predicate) to prevent issues like write skew and phantoms.
    - Solves write skew and phantoms by ensuring that transactions are aware of each other's operations and conflicting actions are avoided.
