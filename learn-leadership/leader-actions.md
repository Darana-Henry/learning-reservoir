# Leadership and Team Management Principles

These principles are essential for effective leadership and fostering a collaborative team environment.

- **The Importance of Letting Go**
    - You can't do everything.
    - If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go as a team.
- **Nurture Your Team's Ideas**
- **Don't Steal Credit**
- **Lead by Example**
    - Over-working and under-working are examples.
- **Time Management**
    - Make your inbox zero.
    - Respond immediately.
    - **Discipline**
      - Have a routine and stick to it. 
      - For example, check emails at 10am, 2pm, and 4pm.
    - **Focus** 
      - Set time aside and block your calendar to work on tasks. 
      - Remove notifications, put your phone on silent, and avoid distractions like Slack.
    - **Delegation**
      - Delegate tasks tactfully to inspire and level up your team members.
    - **Saying No**
      - Saying no is powerful, but do it tactfully. 
      - Avoid overburdening yourself with busy work, and focus on meaningful work when available.
- **Thinking Strategically, Acting Tactically**
    - **Thinking Strategically** - Understand the context and reasons behind the technology. The more you comprehend, the easier it is to build and test effectively.
    - **Acting Tactically** - Draw up a detailed plan to completion, share it, get it reviewed, and make adjustments along the way. Sharing the plan makes it easier for others to see the progress and direction.
- **Avoiding Overcommitment**
    - Always give yourself buffer time to learn, fail, and regroup. Overpromising often leads to under-delivering.
